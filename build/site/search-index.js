Variable Meaning/mapping ${KEYCLOAK_CHART_PATH} The local keycloak helm chart package path ${namespace} The kubernetes namespace where to deploy all the elements of the installation ${registry_url} The keycloak image registry url ${keycloak_repository} the keycloak docker image name ${tag} the keycloak docker image tag name ${kc_user} The keycloak admin user’s username ${kc_password} The keycloak admin user’s password ${db_user} The postgres database user name ${db_password} The postgres database user’s password ${db_name} The postgres database name ${db_url} The postgrws database db url example= jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local:5432/${db_name} ${UPGRADE_CHART_VERSION} The chart version to be used when upgrading the deployment ${UPGRADE_IMAGE_REG} The new image registry to be used when upgrading the deployment ${UPGRADE_IMAGE_REPO} The new image repository to be used when upgrading the deployment ${UPGRADE_IMAGE_TAG} The new image tag to be used when upgrading the deployment Prior to the installation of this component please ensure you have: PostgreSQL Please provide a valida schema/user prior to this installation To add IPv6 support in java options we need to modigy JAVA_OPTS environment variable. Add the custom JAVA_OPTS into your file settings: --set buildEnvs.JAVA_OPTS: \"-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=25.0 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=90.0 -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true\" or vice versa To add IPv4 support in java options we need to modigy JAVA_OPTS environment variable. Add the custom JAVA_OPTS into your file settings: --set buildEnvs.JAVA_OPTS: \"-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=25.0 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=90.0 -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=false\" To add certificates to the images we need a truststore generated. This truststore must be named as server.keystore. keytool -genkeypair -storepass password -storetype PKCS12 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -dname \"CN=server\" -alias server -ext \"SAN:c=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1\" -keystore server.keystore The truststore can be used either as a secret or as configmap. To use the truststore as a Kubernetes secret: Generate Kubernetes secret kubectl create secret generic secret_name --from-file=server.keystore Add the secret to your file settings: --set cacerts.secret=secret_name To use the truststore as a Kubernetes configmap Generate Kubernetes configmap kubectl create configmap configmap_name --from-file=server.keystore Add the configmap to your file settings: --set cacerts.configmap=configmap_name Note : Please note relam name will be mobileum. realm: roles: - authp/admin - authp/user - authp/guest client: \"raid\" portalurl: \"http://localhost:8080\" groups: - name: Admins roles: - authp/admin - name: Editors roles: - authp/user - name: Viewer roles: - authp/guest usernames: - name: adm roles: - authp/admin - authp/user - authp/guest groups: - Admins - Editors - Viewer - name: test roles: - authp/admin - authp/user - authp/guest groups: - Admins - Editors - Viewer save this settings as values.yaml and pass it like file argument as mentioned below. helm install keycloak -f values.yaml The exported realm can be used either as a secret or as configmap. Generate Kubernetes secret kubectl create secret generic realm-secret_name --from-file=realm-export.json Add the secret to your file settings: --set relamExport.secret=realm-secret_name Generate Kubernetes configmap kubectl create configmap realm-configmap_name --from-file=realm-export.json Add the configmap to your file settings: --set relamExport.configmap=realm-configmap_name Images can be either loaded from the AIP package or from the public registry once permissions and access credentials are granted. If you are using the standard package from AIP please use the following: helm install keycloak \\ --set image.registry=${registry_url} \\ --set image.repository=${keycloak_repository} \\ --set image.tag=${tag} \\ --set config.keycloak_user=${kc_user} \\ --set config.keycloak_password=${kc_password} \\ --set db.database_url=${db_url} \\ --set db.databaseName=${db_name} \\ --set db.db_username=${db_user} \\ --set db.db_password=${db_password} \\ --timeout 10m \\ ${KEYCLOAK_CHART_PATH} \\ -n ${namespace} The upgrade process is as simple as executing helm upgrade command, divided into two scenarios: Upgrade image: Deployment is upgraded with a new image. After the upgrade completes, the old pod will be removed, and a new one with the upgraded image will spawn. Upgrade configurations: To upgrade only the configurations of the current deployment (charts). In this case, after the upgrade completes, it might be necessary to restart the deployment depending on the change. Upgrade deployment by executing: helm upgrade keycloak \\ --set image.registry=\"${UPGRADE_IMAGE_REG}\" \\ --set image.repository=\"${UPGRADE_IMAGE_REPO}\" \\ --set image.tag=\"${UPGRADE_IMAGE_TAG}\" \\ --set db.dbMigration=true \\ --timeout 10m \\ ${KEYCLOAK_CHART_PATH} \\ -n ${namespace} \\ --version \"${UPGRADE_CHART_VERSION}\" Before launching keycloak lets configure http and https related configuration: HTTPS Scheme: if keycloak is deployed over HTTPS scheme then continue using. HTTP Scheme: If keycloak is deployed over HTTP scheme then do these extra steps in place Kubectl -n ${namespace} exec -it `kubectl -n ${namespace} get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=keycloak -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"` bash cd /opt/keycloak/bin ./kcadm.sh config credentials --server http://localhost:8080/ --realm master --user ${KEYCLOAK_ADMIN} --password ${KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD} --config /tmp/kcadm.config ./kcadm.sh update realms/master -s sslRequired=NONE --config /tmp/kcadm.config If keycloak service exposed on loadbalancer then open loadbalancer/custom url to launch keycloak in your web browser. else lets open port-forwarding like this kubectl port-forward service/keycloak [local port]:8080 --address 0.0.0.0 -n ${namespace} & open http://[server ip address]:[local port] in web browser Open keycloak web ui and click on Administration console Then login with keycloak admin user then got to manage > clients > create a client with below information. General Settings Client Protocol \"openid-connect\" Cliend Id raid_portal Name raid_portal Description \"\" click on next and then save . Now you will see more setting to configure follow below sections to set these settings . Access settings Root URL ${PORTAL_URL} Valid Redirect URIs ${PORTAL_URL}/* Admin URL ${PORTAL_URL} Web Origins ${PORTAL_URL} Login settings Login theme Mobileum and save again. Edit created client > Client Scopes > click ${Cliend Id}-dedicated in assigned client scopes > \"Mappers\" tab and add below 3 mappers. Click on \"\"Add predefined mappers\"\" button and then check on \"realm roles\" and then click on Add selected. Edit \"realm roles\" mapper and check on all toggles and update \"Token Claim Name\" as \"roles\" and save. click on \"Add predefined mappers\" button and then check on \"client roles\" and then click on Add selected. Click on Add Mapper > By Configuration > then select \"Group Membership\" to create a new mapper. and set following values and toggle all button to true and then save. Mapper Type Group Membership Protocol openid-connect Name group Token Claim Name group Go to Manage > Realm Roles and click on \"Create Role\" button and then fill the form with new role Name eg. admin and fill the description and save the form. verify new roles admin is created and present in all roles list. Go to Manage > Groups and click on \"Create Group\" button and then fill the form with new group Name eg. admin then save the form. verify admin group is created and present in all groups list. we can add custom users one by one and we can integrate a lightweight active directory or any user federation like ldap to manage users and associated groups and roles in keycloak. we will see how to do that in next sections. Go to Manage > Users and click on \"Add user\" button and then fill the form. example of adding adm user with following details and save Username adm Email adm@mobileum.com Email Verified on First Name Admin Last Name mobileum click save Edit the user and set password in credentials tab. Edit the user and Go to Role Mappings tab and click on \"Assign Role\" button and then select a particular role present in Available roles list and then click on \"Assign\" button to assign that particular role. Example: map admin role created above to this user Edit the user Go to Groups tab and click on \"Join Group\" select a particular group present in Available Groups list and then click on Join button to join that particular Group. Example: map admin group created above to this user Go to Configure > User federation > Add Ldap Providers .see ldap configuration page is opened with heading \"Add user federation provider heading\". Note: Set following items as per requirement. General options Console display name ldap Vendor ActiveDirectory or select based on preferred type Connection and authentication settings Connection URL ldap://:389 Bind Type simple Bind DN set bind dn Bind Credential set bind dns password LDAP searching and updating Edit Mode READ_ONLY Users DN set to user dn attribute Username LDAP attribute sAMAccountName or chnage as per the ldap attribute RDN LDAP attribute sAMAccountName or chnage as per the ldap attribute UUID LDAP attribute objectGUID User Object Classes person, organizationalPerson, user User LDAP Filter set user ldap filter Search Scope Subtree Read timeout Pagination Synchronization settings Import users On Sync Registrations On Batch size Periodic full sync Periodic changed users sync leave rest as it is and then click on save once ldap federation account created then click on \"Synchronize all users\" button which is enabled after saving the ldap form. Go to Configure > User federation > ldap > Mappers tab and click on create button to create a new mapper with following details and then save. Name AD-GROUPS Mapper-Type select \"group-ldap-mapper\" from dropdown see more options listed now fill this new options. LDAP Groups DN set group dn attribute based on ldap provider Group Name LDAP Attribute cn Group Object Classes group Preserve Group Inheritance on Ignore Missing Groups OFF Membership LDAP Attribute member Membership Attribute Type DN Membership User LDAP Attribute set sAMAccountName or set baased on ldap provider LDAP Filter set filter based on attribute provider Mode READ_ONLY User Groups Retrieve Strategy LOAD_GROUPS_BY_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE Member-Of LDAP Attribute memberOf Mapped Group Attributes keep as blank Drop non-existing groups during sync OFF Groups Path \"/\" once mapper created click on \"Sync LDAP Groups to Keycloak\" button which is enabled after saving the mapper form. This step will integrate the keycloak sso with raid portal web ui . Download installed product-config.xml of portal component and append the below CustomPortalProperties under global tag and update product-config.xml inside cleanup,setup and startup directory of portal component in object storage. Note: Update ${PORTAL_URL_WITH_PORT} and ${KEYCLOAK_URL_WITH_PORT} in the below configuration first. # sso properties sso.enabled=true sso.callback.url=http://${PORTAL_URL_WITH_PORT}/callback sso.auth.type=oidc # mapping configurations # Map role as sso.mapped.role.= # Map group as user_group./= sso.mapped.attributes=preferred_username:name,roles:role,group:user_group sso.mapped.role.admin=Administrator sso.mapped.user_group./admin=Administrator # Open ID Connect configurations oidc.discovery.uri=http://${KEYCLOAK_URL_WITH_PORT}/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration oidc.client.id=raid_portal oidc.client.secret=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX In this step upload updated sso.war inside startup/plugins directory of portal component in object storage. ./bin/deploymentmanager.sh restart This step will remove all the objects previously created and the deployments previously created.
